I purchased the ticket one day before the concert, determined to skip the research work for a night!

## Violin Concerto No. 3
The concert opened with the vibrant rhythms of Saint-Saëns' Violin Concerto No. 3.
The first movement was a tapestry of vivid colors and emotional acoustics, masterfully played by the solo violinist Jeff Thayer.
As the music transitioned into the second movement, the piece transformed into a gentle, melodious song that resonated throughout the concert hall, its sweetness akin to honey.
The third movement burst forth with energy, culminating in a powerful march.
The violin weaved through the rhythms with precision, making for an ingenious and lively performance.

## Symphony No. 3 "Organ"
The second half featured the majestic Organ Symphony by Saint-Saëns.
The organ's rich, vivid tones amazed the audience as light danced across the shades when the chamber opened and closed.
The finale was particularly impactful, as the organ's grand sound mixed seamlessly with the orchestra, bringing the piece to a breathtaking climax.
This symphonic journey took the audience from mysterious depths to a triumphant climax, delivering a performance that was both glamorous and captivating.

It is amazing to know the history of this Robert Morton pneumatic pipe organ in the video:

## A Musical Tribute
In the wake of the recent fires in Los Angeles, this concert served as a poignant reminder of the healing power of music.
The CEO of the San Diego Symphony took a moment to pay tribute to those affected by the fires, highlighting the solidarity within the music community.
She also noted that the musicians of the LA Phil were not scheduled to perform that day, allowing the focus to be on the collective support and empathy shared through this musical experience.
Let us continue to use music as a beacon of hope and resilience for those affected.
