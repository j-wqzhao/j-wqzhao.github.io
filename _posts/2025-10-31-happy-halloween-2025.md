Happy Halloween 2025! 🎃

See my [GitHub](https://github.com/Teddy-van-Jerry) contribution graph!
You may find out today I also made several contributions (to my private repositories) for my (ghost 👻) research projects.

The Warren bear at UCSD is also celebrating Halloween by wearing a pumpkin 🎃 at one of its cute little ears!

Nice to see the halloween boba milk tea 🥤 (not so delicious though).
