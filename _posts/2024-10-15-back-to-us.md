## Back to University of California San Diego
I have been back to the United States as a PhD student at the University of California San Diego!
It is a great place to study and live.
I will share more later on this website, now that I have reduced the use of Twitter.
It is good to host information on my own open-source platform.

## More on This Journal
Besides, I will continue to work on the LaTeX template for this journal,
which is open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/j-wqzhao/j-wqzhao.cls).
The operation of this journal will shift a little from publishing in PDF.
HTML (generated from Markdown) formats are also supported, because we want to facilitate the faster sharing of information!
(Well, I am not saying I am being lazy to write a LaTeX document. Yes, I am honest.)
