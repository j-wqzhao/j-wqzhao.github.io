It is great for a PhD student to enjoy music at weekends.
In the summer of 2023 when I visited UC San Diego as a research intern,
I have already got the chance to listen to some live music performances in San Diego,
including the organ performance from the Spreckels Organ Society and dual pianos rehearsal from the La Jolla Music Society.
Now, in the 2024--2025 season, I have explored more about the available concerts and operas in San Diego.

## Resurrection
> Time
> : 2:00 PM PDT -- Sun, Oct 6, 2024
>
> Location
> : Jacobs Music Center, San Diego

After stepping the newly renovated Jocobs Music Center,
I was amazed by the beauty of the hall blended with both lines and colors.
The sensation of coolness and warmth was felt at the same time.
The traditional and historical style of the hall was well preserved while new technologies were also integrated to enhance the acoustic experience.
In the lecture prior to the performance, I know the great acoustics of the hall, claimed to be "the best in the west coast."
Wow, I cannot wait to enjoy the performance.

The first half of the concert was the performance of Thomas Larcher's *Time, Three Movements for Orchestra*,
which shows the glamorous sound effect of this hall.

The second half was the performance of Mahler's *Symphony No. 2 (Resurrection)*, which I was looking forward to.
This symphony is one of my favorite pieces of Mahler.
The piece is so powerful and touching, and I am almost into tears at the end of the performance.
The words "I shall die, so as to live!" (Sterben werd' ich, um zu leben!) were so inspiring, along with the orchestral and choral performance.
Yes, resurrection. I feel the resurrection of life and spirit. Arise from the dead!

The performance directed by Rafael Payare was so great: energetic, passionate, and non-traditional.
The speed was flexible in different places to express the emotions of the music,
bringing a new perspective to me.

After the performance, I talked to the person sitting next to me, a viola player from the La Jolla Symphony.
She talked to me about her own experience of playing Mahler's symphonies.
Wow, that was wonderful.

## Schoenberg and Beethoven
> Time

> Location
> : Jacobs Music Center, San Diego

This time I chose a cheaper seat at the balcony, but the sound was still great, and the view was even broader.
Though the music was great, [shock on the trolley](#shock-on-the-trolley) just made me uncomfortable and nervous that day.

### Schoenberg: Pelléas und Mélisande, Op. 5
I seldom listened to Schoenberg's music before,
but this performance of *Pelléas und Mélisande* was so impressive,
and presented me with a new perspective of Schoenberg's early music: romantic, passionate, and full of emotions.
The story and fantasy of the story were so vividly expressed by the music.

### Beethoven: Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 61
The violinist Pinchas Zukerman jumps in for performance,
and the piece was changed from the Brahms's to the Beethoven's Violin Concerto.
I am kind of equal to both pieces, but I am still excited to listen to the Beethoven's,
which has a great orchestration.
Before entering the hall, I talked to someone who was a fan of Beethoven's music and said the change was a surprise.
Pinchas Zukerman's performance was so great, and the orchestra was so supportive,
so there was both details and passion in the performance.

## La Bohème

After the [shock on the trolley](#shock-on-the-trolley), I was still able to

## Shock on the Trolley

As usual, I took the blue line trolley to the downtown, sitting near the window and enjoying the beautiful view and the great weather.
Between Nobel Drive station and the Balboa Avenue station, a man in the black hoodie suddenly shouted and pushed the person (a UCSD student actually) sitting near him.
Then what I saw was the man in black wielding a knife and punched the student.
The student was pushed forward, standing, with blood watering down his neck.
The trolley is still moving.
In this car there were only a few people, including two girls behind me.
I was so shocked to see this even though I have always been cautious on the public transit.
Death seemed to be so close, but I did not have the mind to think about the wills.
The man in black walked back and forth in the narrow aisle, and I was so nervous, holding my backpack in my arms, and avoiding any eye contact with the knife man.

Despite the danger, I still grabbed some delicious tacos at downtown near the 5th Avenue before going back home on the blue line trolley.
