It's always great for a PhD student to savor music on the weekends!
In the summer of 2023, when I visited UC San Diego as a research intern, I was lucky enough to catch several live performances,
including an organ recital by the Spreckels Organ Society and a dual piano rehearsal hosted by the La Jolla Music Society.
Now, for the 2024–2025 season, I've discovered even more concerts and operas around San Diego.

## Resurrection
> Time
> : 2:00 PM PDT -- Sun, Oct 6, 2024
>
> Location
> : Jacobs Music Center, San Diego

Stepping into the newly renovated Jacobs Music Center, I was immediately struck by the way its historic design harmonizes with modern elements.
The hall exudes both coolness and warmth, a testament to its preserved heritage and new acoustic technology.
In a pre-performance talk, I learned why many call these acoustics "the best on the West Coast."
I couldn't wait for the music to begin!

The first half of the concert was the performance of Thomas Larcher's *Time, Three Movements for Orchestra*,
which showcased the hall's stunning acoustics.
Each note revealed the venue’s rich, resonant quality.

Then came the second half of the concert.
Mahler's *Symphony No. 2* is one of my favorite pieces.
It’s powerful and emotional, and I nearly teared up at the end.
The words "I shall die, so as to live!" (Sterben werd’ ich, um zu leben!) felt incredibly moving,
especially with the orchestra and chorus in full force.
This performance by the [San Diego Symphony](https://www.sandiegosymphony.org/) under Rafael Payare was energetic, passionate, and refreshingly non-traditional.
The flexible tempo lent extra emotional depth, giving me a new perspective on a familiar masterpiece.

Afterward, I chatted with a viola player from the La Jolla Symphony.
She shared her experience of performing Mahler's symphonies
--- an unforgettable conversation that capped an inspiring afternoon.

[San Diego Story also gave a glowing review](https://sandiegostory.com/san-diego-symphonys-soaring-inspiring-mahler-second-symphony-resurrection/) to this wonderful performance.

## Schoenberg and Beethoven
> Time
> : 2:00 PM PDT -- Sun, Oct 13, 2024
>
> Location
> : Jacobs Music Center, San Diego

This time, I chose a cheaper balcony seat.
Despite the lower price, the acoustics were still excellent, and I enjoyed a panoramic view of the hall.
Unfortunately, I had a disquieting experience on the trolley earlier (see [Shock on the Trolley](#shock-on-the-trolley)),
which left me feeling uneasy before the show.

### Schoenberg: Pelléas und Mélisande, Op. 5
I rarely listened to Schoenberg, but this performance of *Pelléas und Mélisande* deeply impressed me.
It revealed a lush, romantic side of Schoenberg's early music --- brimming with passion and emotion.
The piece vividly evoked the story's dreamlike quality.

### Beethoven: Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 61
[Pinchas Zukerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Zukerman) stood in for the originally scheduled soloist,
switching the planned Brahms Violin Concerto to Beethoven's. Although I like both composers, I was thrilled for the Beethoven.
I spoke with a die-hard Beethoven fan in the lobby who was pleasantly surprised by the change.
The orchestra's supportive accompaniment gave Zukerman's performance ample room for both detail and passion.

## La Bohème
> Time
> : 2:00 PM PST -- Sun, Nov 3, 2024
>
> Location
> : Civic Theatre, San Diego

Still rattled by the [shock on the trolley](#shock-on-the-trolley),
I nonetheless took the trolley again to the Civic Theatre.
Inside, I felt much safer and managed to grab a sandwich for lunch.

The [San Diego Opera](https://www.sdopera.org/) production of Puccini's *La Bohème* was outstanding.
Despite a minimalist stage, the modern yet faithful adaptation showcased the story's timeless beauty.
The singer's voices soared, filling the theater with heartfelt emotion.
I was especially moved during Mimi’s death scene --- seeing it live was far more affecting than any recording I've heard.
I left with renewed resolve to persevere despite life's challenges.

## Shock on the Trolley

> **Warning:** The following content contains violence and may be disturbing to some readers.
{: .prompt-warning }

On the way downtown via the Blue Line trolley,
I was enjoying the view when a man in a black hoodie suddenly shouted and attacked a UCSD student nearby.
He wielded a knife and struck the student, drawing blood.
The trolley kept moving between Nobel Drive and Balboa Avenue stations.
Fear gripped me --- I clutched my backpack and avoided eye contact. 

When we finally reached Balboa Avenue, everyone dashed toward the first car to find the conductor.
The injured student remained remarkably calm, and we alerted the police.
The attacker fled.
At the Tecolote Road station, officers arrived, interviewed us, and asked all passengers to switch to another trolley.
One elderly concertgoer said she had never witnessed such violence on San Diego transit.
Although still shaken, I made it to the performance just in time --- but I couldn't easily shake off the shock.

Despite the danger, I enjoyed some delicious tacos at Tacos El Gordo near 5th Avenue after the concert,
then hopped back on the Blue Line to head home.
