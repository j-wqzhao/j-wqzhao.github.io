Happy 20th Bear-thday to the [Bear 🧸 at UCSD](https://stuartcollection.ucsd.edu/artist/hawkinson.html)!
I even got a special bear-thday cake to celebrate this joyful day.

## Symphony, to the Bear
To celebrate the bear's 20th birthday,
I attended the concert **Where Shining Trumpets Blow** at the [San Diego Symphony](https://www.sandiegosymphony.org/),
featuring Mahler's *Des Knaben Wunderhorn* (The Boy's Magic Horn) and Bruckner's *Symphony No. 4*.
The trumpets and french horns were so magnificent and I am sure the bear loved it too!
